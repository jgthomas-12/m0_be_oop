# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - Once in awhile I get caught up with the googling because I'm having trouble finding EXACTLY what I need and or I'm not understanding how to use it properly. Otherwise the technical understanding as to why things work the way the do seems to be coming pretty naturally. I like how the methods and techniques build on each other. Once you have an understanding of how something works, it's usually easy enough to utilize that understanding and plug new techniques into it.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - I probably need to take more breaks. I find that once I start something I don't usually walk away until I'm stuck or finished. It will probably be better for productivity and maybe it will help increase the workflow.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    - Try and go throug the problems and lessons before we dig into them as a class. Having a small amount of insight prior to starting Mod 0 has made understanding the information much easier. Keep focusing on communication and working through problems with different people. Everyone has a different learning style and encounters different problems. Sometimes the easiest solutions take the longest time to fix because they blend in with the code easily.
